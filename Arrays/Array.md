# What is an Array ?

Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location. It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.
Array can contain primitives (int, char, etc.) as well as object (or non-primitive) references of a class depending on the definition of the array. In case of primitive data types, the actual values are stored in contiguous memory locations.

## Types of Array in java

There are two types of array.
